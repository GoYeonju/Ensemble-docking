# Ensemble-docking

This file was created by Yeon Ju Go with the advice of professor Young Min Rhee in the Computational Photodynamics Research Lab of the Department of Chemistry at Korea Advanced Institue of Science and Technology.

This folder contains the initial structures for VEGF165, RNV66, V7t1, del5-1, RNV66:del5-1, and V7t1:del5-1, along with the necessary input, parameters, topology files, scripts, etc., for MD simulations, docking, MM/GBSA calculations, and further analyses. 

To carry out these computations, ensure that GROMACS 2022, AmberTools22, and HDOCK are installed, with the paths correctly specified. 
Additionally, make appropriate modifications to the paths in the attached shell script files.

To execute the calculations, refer to and follow the instructions provided in the README file attached to each directory within this folder.
